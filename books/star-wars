Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Don't underestimate the Force. I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Hey, Luke! May the Force
be with you. I call it luck.

Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a
planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Red Five standing by. I want to come
with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force
and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and
inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Don't underestimate the Force. Escape is
not his plan. I must face him, alone.

Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I'm
surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. What!? I can't get involved!
I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do
about it right now. It's such a long way from here.
